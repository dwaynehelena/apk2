**Codename**: Allwinner Ace

## 🚀 Allwinner A133 + HiWorld Integration
This update brings full native support for the Allwinner A133 chipset and HiWorld LHL protocol suite.

*   **Deep Diagnostics Mode**: New interactive startup sequence that probes kernel-level settings and vendor-specific receivers.
*   **HiWorld Protocol Auto-Detect**: Automatically identifies HiWorld LHL signatures during boot.

## 📡 Sniffer Improvements
*   **Service Binding**: Added support for binding to `com.tw.carinfoservice` and `com.dofun.carassistant.car` for real-time broadcast interception.
