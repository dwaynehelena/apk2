# Project Constitution

## Core Principles
1. **TDD (Test Driven Development)**: Tests must be written before implementation code.
2. **SOLID**: Adhere to SOLID principles in design.
3. **Local-First**: Prefer local execution and validation.
4. **Accountability**: Every task completion must be logged.

## Quality Standards
- No broken tests allowed in main branch.
- TypeScript strict mode must be preserved.
- Python code must follow PEP8 guidelines.

## Governance
- Amendments to this constitution require human approval.
